# slackbot
It is a slackbot which i am developing using Docker and Kubernetes techology.The slackbot will allow the user to execute kubernetes commands using the slackbot and deploy projects in the cloud.I am exploring DevOps and its differnt tools.This project was my first attempt at DevOps and i got to lear about Docker and Kubernetes.I learnt docker but still learning about kubernetes.
